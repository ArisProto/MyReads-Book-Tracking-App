# MyReads Project

This Project was undertaken during the Udacity Front-End-Nanodegree as part of the React-Courses.
We were given a static example of CSS and HTML markup (to save time) after which we had to refactor the given code with React.js code in order to make it interactive!

The code is not perfect yet, but with a bit of time, it might just turn into something awesome!

## How To Run The Application

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. From inside the new directory:
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the server with `npm start`
3. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## How to uses

The App consists of a home Page and a page for searching books. On the home page you can organize your books into 3 categories (/shelfs): 'currently reading', 'want to read' and 'read' and you can delete or add books at will, by either clicking on the 'None' option (to delete a book from your shelfs) or by clicking on the plus button in the bottom right corner of your screen to be re-routed to the search page, in order to search for books that you can then add to your shelfs!

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
